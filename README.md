Project FamiOwl
It is kids’ nature to play games, but parents often find it difficult to control the amount of time their kids spend on playing. While playing is a way for children to learn stuff quickly while enjoying, it is also a fact that playing too much video games would result in addiction, poor eyesight, and loss of attention.

We noticed that parents are often busy with their jobs, and that they barely have time to control their kids’ time on games. We believe that it is neither a good choice to let their kids play the whole day or don’t play at all. Thus, we want to build a software that governs the amount of time kids spend on video games. In this way, kids would have the opportunity to play games as they want, and parents could leave their children playing games without any concerns.

Our product, FamiOwl is a game distribution platform integrated with a monitoring tool that solves the problem above. FamiOwl would count the amount of time kids spent on games, and prevent kids from playing too long in front of the computer. It would have its own published games that are validated for kids only. Users could also add their own games to the software, and FamiOwl would monitor activities to games from both sources. Parents could control the behavior of FamiOwl and set rules to each game individually via a web page. They can see which game their kids are playing, how much time their kids have spent on it, and close the game remotely if necessary. 
Why This Project?
We think this project is significant because it protects children’s health in various ways. It allows children to play video games with adequate care, as supervisors can manage their children's video game time. It also gives game publishers and game developers a platform to distribute their products to gamers at a young age, and parents won’t be worrying about the content because all games will be validated. At the same time, it includes a variety of convenient features: in-game time recording, remote monitoring & restricting, game progress saving, in-app voice calling, etc.
